# Chatboard

Realtime collaborative rooms with video, live coding and synchronized layout.

Built with (among other things):
- [simple webRTC](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/SimpleWebRTC)
- [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/)
- [Firepad](http://www.firepad.io/)
- [Angular Gridster](https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/angular-gridster)

## Setting up:

You will need to set up a signalling server for webRTC, [signalmaster](https://github.com/andyet/signalmaster) looks like a easy option.

To launch the demo

```
node launch
```
